Task 5: Model Evaluation & Interpretation
Objective:
Evaluate the best churn prediction model, interpret feature importance, and visualize model performance using the ROC curve and AUC.

Model Evaluated: Random Forest Classifier

Accuracy: 79%
Precision (Churn class): 63%
Recall (Churn class): 46%
F1-Score (Churn class): 53%
AUC Score: 0.82 ✅

Key Outputs:
1.Classification Report:
    Churn class has slightly lower recall, indicating the model misses some churners
    But overall performance is stable and acceptable for business use
2.Top 10 Features Influencing Churn:
    Visualized in task5_feature_importance.png
    Likely top features: Contract_Two year, tenure, MonthlyCharges, InternetService_Fiber optic
3.ROC Curve:
    Saved as task5_roc_curve.png
    Shows model’s balance between true and false positives
    AUC of 0.82 indicates good predictive capability
