Task 4: Churn Prediction Model
Objective:
Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict customer churn using the prepared Telco dataset.

Models Used:
 Logistic Regression
 Decision Tree
 Random Forest

Logistic Regression and Random Forest both performed similarly and better than Decision Tree, but churn class recall is still low, indicating the model misses some actual churn cases.

Warning Observed:
Logistic Regression gave a ConvergenceWarning.
Reason: The model hit its max iterations (1000) before finding a perfect solution.

Conclusion:
You built three solid models and identified that:
 Logistic Regression is a strong baseline
 Random Forest offers competitive performance
 Model recall needs improvement if you want to reduce customer loss
