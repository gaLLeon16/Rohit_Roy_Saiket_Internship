Task 3: Customer Segmentation

Objective:
Segment telecom customers based on tenure, monthly charges, and contract type to analyze churn behavior and identify high-value customers at risk.

Segmentation Performed:
1.Tenure-Based Segments:
    Created 4 tenure groups:
    0–12, 13–24, 25–48, 49–72 months
  Observation:
   Churn is highest in the first 12 months and decreases with longer tenure.

3.Contract Type Analysis:
    Compared Month-to-month, One year, and Two year
  Observation:
    Churn was highest for Month-to-month contracts.
    Long-term contracts show better retention.

High-Value, High-Risk Customers Identified:
  Criteria:
    High monthly charges (High or Very High)
    Short tenure (0–12 or 13–24 months)
    Churned customers
   Result:
    These customers were filtered and saved for targeted retention strategies.
    [Saved as: high_risk_customers.csv]

Conclusion:
This segmentation provides strong business insights:
   Retention strategies should focus on early-stage, high-paying users
   Offering longer-term contracts and early loyalty benefits may reduce churn
