Task 6: Business Recommendations

Objective:
Translate data insights into actionable strategies to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

Key Risk Indicators Identified:
Customers with Month-to-month contracts churn more often
Short tenure (0–12 months) customers are high risk
High MonthlyCharges leads to higher churn
Lack of OnlineSecurity or TechSupport is a strong churn signal
Customers using Electronic Check as payment method churn more

Actionable Recommendations:
1.Incentivize Long-term Contracts
   Offer discounts for switching to 1 or 2-year contracts
   Could reduce churn by up to 20–30% in high-risk segments
2.Target Early-Stage Customers
   Provide loyalty rewards or onboarding support in the first 6–12 months
   Helps retain users during the most vulnerable period
3.Bundle Security & Support Services
   Offer free or trial-based OnlineSecurity and TechSupport to Fiber optic users
   Can reduce churn in high-usage, high-cost segments
4.Replace Electronic Check Options
   Promote credit/debit auto-pay options with small cashback rewards
   Reduces churn among low-trust payment users
5.Create a Churn Alert System
   Use your Random Forest model to score new users weekly
   Proactively reach out to those at high churn risk

Estimated Impact:
If applied correctly, these strategies could:
  Increase retention by 15–25%
  Save revenue by reducing churn-driven losses
  Improve customer satisfaction in vulnerable groups
