Task 1: Data Preparation

Objective:
Prepare the Telco Customer Churn dataset for analysis and modeling by cleaning, transforming, and splitting the data

Steps Performed:
1.Loaded the dataset
    Rows: 7043 | Columns: 21
    No missing values detected in raw data.
2.Data type correction
    Converted TotalCharges from string to numeric.
    Dropped rows where conversion resulted in NaN.
3.Dropped non-informative column
    Removed customerID as it doesn't contribute to churn prediction.
4.Encoded categorical variables
    Binary columns like Partner, Dependents, etc., were mapped to 1/0.
    Remaining categorical features were one-hot encoded using pd.get_dummies().
5.Split dataset
    80% training set: 5625 records
    20% testing set: 1407 records
    Final features: 30 numerical columns

Outcome:
Dataset is now fully numeric and ready for analysis and machine learning.
No missing values or unnecessary columns.
Balanced preparation for EDA and modeling tasks ahead.
