Rohit Roy – SaiKet Systems Data Science Internship

📌 Overview
This repository contains my Data Science Internship project with SaiKet Systems, focused on Customer Churn Analysis.
The project involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and feature importance visualization using Python.

📂 Project Structure
│── Task1/   # Data Exploration & Preprocessing  
│── Task2/   # Descriptive Analysis & Visualization  
│── Task3/   # Customer Segmentation  
│── Task4/   # Predictive Modeling (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)  
│── Task5/   # Feature Importance & ROC Analysis  
│── Task6/   # Key Churn Drivers Analysis  
│── Telco_Customer_Churn_Dataset.csv  # Dataset used

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy – Data handling & preprocessing
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
Scikit-learn – Machine learning models
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code – Development environment

📊 Key Highlights
Performed data cleaning and handled missing values.
Conducted EDA to identify patterns and churn trends.
Built and compared ML models for churn prediction.
Created visualizations for churn distribution, trends, and key drivers.
Identified top factors influencing churn to help reduce customer loss.

📈 Results Summary
Best model: Random Forest with AUC Score: 0.82.
Top churn drivers: Total Charges, Monthly Charges, Tenure, Internet Service Type, Payment Method, etc.

📜 Certificate
I successfully completed my B.Sc. Data Science Internship from July 2025 – August 2025 at SaiKet Systems.
